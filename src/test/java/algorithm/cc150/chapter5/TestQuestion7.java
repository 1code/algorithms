/**
 * An array A contains all the integers from 0 to n, except for one 
 * number which is missing. In this problem, we cannot access an entire 
 * integer in A with a single operation. The elements of A are represented 
 * in binary, and the only operation we can use to access them is 
 * "fetch the jth bit of A[i]", which takes constant time. Write code to 
 * find the missing integer. Can you do it in O(n) time?
