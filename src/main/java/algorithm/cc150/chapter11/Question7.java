/**
 * A circus is designing a tower routine consisting of people standing atop one
 * another's shoulders. For practical and aesthetic reasons, each person must be
 * both shorter and lighter than the person below him or her. Given the heights
 * and weights of each person in the circus, write a method to compute the
 * largest possible number of people in such a tower.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE:
 * Input (ht, wt): (65, 200) (70, 150) (56, 90) (75, 190) (60, 95) (68, 110)
 * Output: The longest tower is length 6 and includes from top to bottom:
 * (56, 90) (60, 95) (65, 100) (68, 110) (70, 150) (75, 190)
