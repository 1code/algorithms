/**
 * You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and wo bit operations, i and j.
 * Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit
 * i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of
 * M. That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits
 * between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M
 * could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
 * 
 * EXAMPLE Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6 Output: N =
 * 1001001100
