Algorithms
=========

Include the test-cases and the sketch of the algorithms for the common algorithm questions.

File Organization:

* basic: basic algorithms
* cc150: the problems in cracking the code interview
* dp: the popular dynamic programming problems, excluding the problems in cc150 and lc
* lc: the problems in leetcode
* recursive: the popular recursive problem, excluding the problems in cc150 and lc

#Problem List: 
## [basic](https://github.com/yxjiang/algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/algorithm/baisic)
* binary search
* binary tree
* binary search tree (BST)
* +-*/ expression calculation

## cc150
### [chapter 1](https://github.com/yxjiang/algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/algorithm/cc150/chapter1)
* all unique character
* reverse string
* whether one string is the permutation of the other
* replace blank space with '%20'
* run length encoding
* rotate image in place
* set matrix zeros
* check string rotation using substring

### [chapter 2](https://github.com/yxjiang/algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/algorithm/cc150/chapter2)
* remove duplicate from unsorted linked list
* find the kth to the last from a singly linked list (needs improvement)
* delete the middle element from linked list (needs improvement)
* partition list
* add numbers
* detect the begining of the loop
* check whether a linked list is a palindrome (needs improvement)

### [chapter 3](https://github.com/yxjiang/algorithms/blob/master/src/main/java/algorithm/cc150/chapter3)
* use an array to implement three stacks (not implemented)
* add 'push', 'pop', and 'min' operations for stack, all operations should be in O(1)
* set of stacks
* hanoi
* implement a queue with two stacks
* sort the elements in stack in ascending order
* animal shelter

## dp
* longest increasing subsequences

## recursive
* lowest common ancestor (node with parent pointer and node with left/right children pointers)
