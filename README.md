Algorithms
=========

Include the test-cases and the sketch of the algorithms for the common algorithm questions.

Organization:

* basic: basic algorithms
* cc150: the problems in cracking the code interview
* dp: the popular dynamic programming problems, excluding the problems in cc150 and lc
* lc: the problems in leetcode
* recursive: the popular recursive problem, excluding the problems in cc150 and lc

Problem List: 
## basic
* binary search
* binary tree
* binary search tree (BST)

## recursive
* lowest common ancestor (node with parent pointer and node with left/right children pointers)
